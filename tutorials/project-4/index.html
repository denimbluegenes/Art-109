        <h1>Project 4: The Internet in the Future</h1>
        
        <p>Where the Internet is right now, it's full of endless wonder and possibilities: gambling online or buying groceries from one touch of a button. We have as a society created an easy-going life, especially in entertainment down to worldwide news and we have also created downfalls: environmental damages to earth’s water, production of A.I. materials to take over jobs.
        </p>
        <p>In the early 2000s, I remembered the first time I got to witness a product of the Internet – the tv. The TV is one of the biggest connections to see everything and everyone. Whether it was news or game shows from Vietnam to watching cartoons and films my parents would rent from Blockbuster, it was the first step of the internet. It was all visuals for me: colors, imaginations, emotions. That’s how television is.
        </p>
        <p>I can do it all in my home, now. I can rent any film I want, I can play any game I desire. I can simply order the biggest In-N-Out meal without having to be ashamed that I just want to sit at home, turn on the tv, and eat a double-double burger, animal fries with extra spread and a large coke. I can watch the news or I can go on Twitter or Instagram and brain rot on 1-minute reels about meals I’ll never cook or crafts I wish to make; now I have to worry about my future knowing that the Internet is this powerful to like, it's also powerful to ruin.
        </p>
        <p>I have to understand that A.I. can take over my job. There are users who abuse the Internet to spread misinformation to scam for more viewership or to have users believe in false visuals. There will always be a question in my head if I have drank enough water and walked outside, because even being on my phone hurts my head. Some people choose not to own a smartphone at all because the internet is designed to be addictive. To consume what the algorithm knows what to give you, so you can stay powered on.
        </p>
        <p>The internet isn’t fully good or bad. Its impact depends on how people use it. Fifty to a hundred years from now, there will still be harmful users and helpful users. Technology will advance, and society will likely become more tech-savvy. People will use the internet to amplify their voices or simply to entertain themselves. Cameras will increase, age requirements will rise, and systems will become stricter.</p>
        <p>As new apps and products evolve, so will hackers and scammers. To protect future generations, internet safety education will need to be prioritized. Research will also become more important as questionable brands and marketplaces—like Shein, Temu, and AliExpress—continue selling products with weak consumer protection. Physical cash may still exist 50 years from now, but in a hundred years, we may run out of materials to produce.</p>
        <p>Maybe in a century we’ll attempt to revive extinct species, uncover the origins of extraterrestrial life, or finally explore far beyond the surface of the ocean. Technology will evolve, and with it, our awareness, curiosity, and caution must evolve too. The future of the internet will depend on how responsibly we choose to shape it.</p>
        <p>A.I. will become part of our society since they already produce visuals, entertainment and understand a lot of our habits. It will likely become something people depend on, especially because we’ve already been using A.I. for years without realizing it. An example is Adobe After Effects. People do not understand they’re using the A.I. already to create visual motion graphics using natural motion blur made by the A.I. itself. That has been there for a while. It is only increasingly alarming because now, A.I. can take our work, eat it, and spit out material that people desire.
        </p>
        <p>Good parts of the Internet can be education and knowledge shared. People are able to learn languages, be open to different communities, and it can be helpful. An example of an application is Doordash, where many people with families who work don’t have to cook. Traditionally, back then, pizza used to always be delivered. An application like Doordash changed the game when food can be delivered anytime, any day with the help of people who need extra cash to deliver food. The traditional method of delivering has reached a modern and timeless productivity.
        </p>
        <p>The same kind of transformation applies to education. Instead of being limited to teachers and resources in one location, people can now hire tutors online, take virtual classes, or learn specialized topics like a new language or advanced math from educators around the world – you can have multiple resources worldwide. The internet expands opportunities by giving everyone access to knowledge beyond their physical environment.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, the internet will advance society, but that progress depends on how responsibly we choose to use it. It can make life easier, smarter, and more connected, yet its dangers will grow alongside its potential. The future of the internet is not only about technology—it is about the choices we make as humans.</p>
